##### X-Ray Classification Transfer Learning Tutorial - (Keras)

Classification of X-Ray medical images is carried out in this project. One classifier is trained on the original dataset and then a second set of data has perturbations applied to it to simulate image corruption. An example of transfer learning is carried out after this, retraining the original model on the new dataset.

##### Sentiment Analysis
A custom sentiment analysis module was created, based on the voting of multiple classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Stocastic Gradient Descent. The performance of this custom sentiment analysis module is compared with the performance of other sentiment analysis modules.

## Other Python Projects

##### Movie Plot Generator
This project collected plot summaries from a variety of movies catalogued at the Open Movie Database. These plot summaries were then used to create new plot ideas for writers. The project compared multiple methods of generating text, including using an LSTM neural network, a Recurrent Neural Network and Markov Chains.
