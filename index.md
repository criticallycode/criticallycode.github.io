##### XRay Classification Transfer Learning Tutorial - (Keras)

Classification of X-Ray medical images is carried out in this project. One classifier is trained on the original dataset and then a second set of data has perturbations applied to it to simulate image corruption. An example of transfer learning is carried out after this, retraining the original model on the new dataset.

## Other Python Projects

##### Movie Plot Generator
This project collected plot summaries from a variety of movies catalogued at the Open Movie Database. These plot summaries were then used to create new plot ideas for writers. The project compared multiple methods of generating text, including using an LSTM neural network, a Recurrent Neural Network and Markov Chains.
